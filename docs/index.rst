   changelog


``nasdaq-100-ticker-history`` provides the current set and a limited recent history of the stock symbols of
the member companies of the NASDAQ 100 [#n100_overview]_ index.  As the member companies of this index
change regularly [#n100_changes]_, the API is date-centric.  Ie, given a calendar date, it will return the
set of ticker symbols (eg, ``AAPL``) that were in the index on that date.

Coverage
--------

As of version |release|, accurate coverage is provided from Jan 1, 2016 through at least Jun 1, 2023.  Most
likely, the coverage is accurate further into 2023 subject to additional changes being announced by Nasdaq.  A new
version of the API is released on each update Nasdaq announces, typically with a time lag of a few days to a
few weeks.  It is the intent of the project maintainers to provide accurate coverage on an ongoing basis.

Examples
--------
